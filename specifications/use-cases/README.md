### Use Cases:

Armando:
	SOS1, SOS2, SOS3, *SOS5*, *SOS6*, SOS8
Anthony:
	SOS4, *SOS13*, *SOS14*, SOS15, SOS16, SOS17
Kian:
	~~*SOS7*~~, SOS9, SOS10, ~~SOS11~~, *SOS12*

Anthony:
	* SOS14 - Promotion Privileges overlaps with SOS2 - Grant Organizer Role. Both are well formatted and extensive, so we had to decide which one we are going to redo. 

Kian:
	* Please redo SOS7 (Private Account) as it overlaps with one that I had (SOS6 - Ensure User Profile Privacy). You could, for example, turn it into the action of setting an account to private rather than checking if the account is private. I.e., the user goes to his page, clicks a link "make private", inputs some whitelist/blacklist (who gets to see, who doesn't) and the information is relayed to the database. 
	* Please redo SOS22 (Attendance Tracker) as it overlaps with one that I had (SOS4 - Attending an Event). 
	* You are missing one? I only count 5 Use Cases with your name.

Yovanni:
	* Missing 4 Use Cases. Please make sure they don't overlap with the ones we already have. 

Teriq
	* Please add the constrains part to the use case. 
	* SEUC1 - Create Event overlaps with SOS1 - Create Event. Please redo. Maybe an extend create special event that includes more functionalities but also requires more data? Like a Potluck event that requires the organizer to include a list of object that are wanted and tracks on the background who is designed to bring them? 
	* SEUC2 - User Registration overlaps with an use case done by Yovanni, decide how you two want to redo them.
	* SEUC5 - Manage other Organization extends SOS5 - Ensure User Access.
	* SEUC6 feels a bit empty, what is this supposed to do again?
