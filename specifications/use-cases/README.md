Kian:
* Please redo SOS7 (Private Account) as it overlaps with one that I had (SOS6 - Ensure User Profile Privacy). You could, for example, turn it into the action of setting an account to private rather than checking if the account is private. I.e., the user goes to his page, clicks a link "make private", inputs some whitelist/blacklist (who gets to see, who doesn't) and the information is relayed to the database. 
* Please redo SOS22 (Attendance Tracker) as it overlaps with one that I had (SOS4 - Attending an Event). 
* You are missing one? I only count 5 Use Cases with your name.

Yovanni:
* By the way, the `Setting a Task // Committing a Task` use case could be divided into two, one for setting (from the Organizer point of view) and the other one for committing to it (from the member point of view).
